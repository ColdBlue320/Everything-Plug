# What this mod does
This plugin allows operators to easily execute commands this plugin supports. For example, instead of /tellraw formatting, you use python commands but in Minecraft like /print("Message").
Colors are not supported yet, and to use /print("Message") with formatting, you need to use the Vanilla /tellraw command. That's not all this plugin adds - more are to come! 

# Unmaintaned Features
- /print("message")
